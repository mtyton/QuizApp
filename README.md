# HOW TO RUN IT?
##This is a not realease version, here I describe how to run in a Debug mode

### Modules You need to run:
* Django >= 3.0
* Python3
### Running in debuging purpose:
Best way is to create virtualenv:
* https://gist.github.com/Geoyi/d9fab4f609e9f75941946be45000632b  
After activating your virtualenv simply install Django
* For python3
```
pip3 install Django
```
After that simply get to the 'learningApp' module and type:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
